      <h2>Experience</h2>

      <h3>Morgan Stanley - Summer Analyst <span>2016</span></h3>
      <p>
        In 2016 I completed a second summer internship programme at Morgan Stanley, where I was based in a team
        responsible for the development of a Sales and Trading application. I created a microservice for
        accessing and modifying symbol data using C# and the .NET Web API. I also made use of continuous integration
        and test driven development.
      </p>
      <br>

      <h3>Morgan Stanley - Summer Analyst <span>2015</span></h3>
      <p>
        I spent ten weeks on a Technology and Data summer internship programme at Morgan Stanley in London,
        working in the Application Support Group for FX. I was able to gain an understanding of both the technical
        and business sides of their FX trading systems, and came across new technologies such as kdb+. My main
        project was a tool written in Perl that allowed members of the support group to track the flow of orders
        through the trading system in order to diagnose problems.
      </p>
      <br>

      <h3>ScraperWiki - Software Development <span>2013, 2014</span></h3>
      <p>
        I worked at ScraperWiki for six weeks in 2013 and ten weeks in 2014. I created web-based screen
        scraping tools with Python and Javascript. I was also involved in work on the platform backend,
        writing file streaming software in Go and optimising it to run in memory and time constraints.
        ScraperWiki follows the principles of Agile Software Development and Extreme Programming,
        so I participated in pair programming, stand-up meetings, and retrospectives and regularly
        demoed and deployed my work.
      </p>
      <br>

      <h3>Aquarium Software - Technical Support <span>2012</span></h3>
      <p>
        I spent two weeks at Aquarium Software, where my role was to respond to support tickets from clients.
        I also spent some time with the developers of Aquarium, who gave me an introduction to the technologies
        behind the software and introduced me to C#, which I used along with the .NET Framework to develop a small project.
      </p>
      <br>

      <h3>University of Liverpool - Research Assistant <span>2012</span></h3>
      <p>
        Worked for two weeks with a group researching the development of a rectification device capable of operating
        in the terahertz frequency range. I operated optical and electrical measurement apparatus, as well as conducting
        analysis of the data produced by these instruments.
      </p>
      <br>

      <h3>Taskers PLC - IT Support <span>2010</span></h3>
      <p>
        I took a work experience placement for two weeks at Taskers PLC. My responsibilities included installing software,
        configuring new computers, setting up new hardware, updating device firmware and other miscellaneous tasks.
      </p>
      <br>

      <h2>Skills &amp; Expertise</h2>
      <p>
        I am comfortable with Python, Perl, Java, Ruby, JavaScript, Go, C and PHP. I use the OS X and
        Linux operating systems on a regular basis and also have experience with Windows systems. I can
        develop dynamic websites using HTML, CSS and JavaScript and jQuery and have good knowledge of the Django
        and Ruby on Rails web frameworks. I keep all non-trivial code under version control and have experience
        working in a small team and following Agile Software Development. I understand how to optimise software
        for time and memory constraints. Some examples of code I have written can be found on my
        <a href='http://www.github.com/sean-duffy'>GitHub</a> page.
      </p>

      <h2>Hobbies and Interests</h2>

      <p>
        In my spare time I enjoy reading and playing the guitar and piano. I also have an interest in remote control vehicles, and have built my own quadcopter.
        I am an active committee member of my University's Outdoor Society, which arranges walks in Yorkshire and the surrounding counties each sunday.
