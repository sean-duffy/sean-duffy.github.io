  <p>Hi, I&rsquo;m Sean, welcome to my new blog! If you don&rsquo;t know who I am, you can visit my &lsquo;about&rsquo; page for a vague idea.</p>

<p>For a while I&rsquo;ve been considering setting up a blog since I think it&rsquo;s good to be able to document your thoughts and experiences, just in case someone someday finds them interesting, or even helpful! I&rsquo;m not sure how interesting or helpful this blog will prove to be, but I suppose it&rsquo;s worth a try. I&rsquo;ve been using tumblr for a while, you can find a link to my page there in the footer of this page, but I&rsquo;ve never really used it as a formal blog, more for posting photos and reblogging various posts, so I decided to set up a separate blog where I could share my thoughts.</p>

<p>I briefly considered using a service such as Blogger or Wordpress but ultimately decided that I should create my own blog, not only because of the extra control it would allow me but also because it&rsquo;s in the spirit of things, surely a blog focusing on programming and development should be developed by it&rsquo;s author! After first building most of the blog in PHP I discovered <a href="https://www.djangoproject.com">Django</a>, an excellent web framework for Python which I found provided a very elegant and simple solution for my blog, so I decided to start again and build the whole thing using Python and Django.</p>

<p>Since I&rsquo;m starting university this September studying Computer Science, I thought now would be a good time to start my venture into the world of blogging. I&rsquo;m going to be writing about what I&rsquo;m learning, what I&rsquo;m interested in and what I&rsquo;m building, as well as general goings-on. You can expect posts about programming, electronics, university (when it starts) and perhaps some other things such as music. If you&rsquo;d like to know more about me you can visit the aforementioned &lsquo;about&rsquo; page, or click some of the links at the bottom of the page.</p>

<p>So that&rsquo;s it for my first post, hopefully there&rsquo;ll be many more and I won&rsquo;t run out of things to write about too soon!</p>
