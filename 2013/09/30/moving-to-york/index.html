  <h1>Moving to York</h1>
  <time datetime=2013-09-30T10:00:00Z class="post-date">Posted on September 30, 2013</time>
  <p>On Sunday I moved into my new home for the next year: Derwent College at the University of York. I&rsquo;m here studying Computer Systems and Software Engineering, and so far my impression of the place has been great! I have catered accommodation in a very large shared room. My room-mate is Simon, who is studying Theoretical Physics and is from Scarborough.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s plenty of space and we each have a desk, a wardrobe and cupboard and plenty of shelves. Overall I&rsquo;m pretty happy with the room, and luck would have it that the carpets, wardrobes and washbasin were replaced this year, since the previous ones were fairly dated.</p>

<p>All of the buildings in Derwent were built in the 60&rsquo;s and from the architecture it certainly shows. They may not be the prettiest buildings, but they do have a unique appeal and Derwent has some of the largest (and cheapest!) rooms.</p>

<p>So far I&rsquo;ve been settling in well, I&rsquo;ve met a lot of people and like what I&rsquo;ve seen of the University. Tomorrow and during the rest of the week I&rsquo;ll be having induction activities specific to Computer Science, so I&rsquo;ll be looking forward to seeing the department and meeting more students who are studying CS. I also have Friday to look forward to, when the Battle Pi and Blue Pi Thinking events are taking place.</p>
