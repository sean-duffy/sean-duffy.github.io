  <h1>Moving to London</h1>
  <time datetime=2015-06-28T10:00:00Z class="post-date">Posted on June 28, 2015</time>
  <p>Three weeks ago, after a lot of hard work, revision and exams I finished second year! It was a good year, with plenty of new and interesting material,
and an embedded systems group project which involved creating a networked &lsquo;digital orchestra&rsquo; and was a lot of fun. After two weeks at home, I moved to London
to begin my summer internship at Morgan Stanley.</p>

<p>After working at ScraperWiki last summer and experiencing the startup work style, I wanted to try something different, and this coupled with my interest
in the finance industry lead me to decide to apply for internships at a few investment banks in London. After spending a considerable amount of time filling
in online applications, I was given a phone interview by Morgan Stanley, who on the basis of this then invited me to their office in Canary Wharf, London
for an assessment day.</p>

<p>This required me to get the train down to London (expenses paid, of course) and spend a full day in the office, taking part in a group exercise and three individual
interviews, two of which were technical and one was interpersonal. Before this I&rsquo;d never really had a formal job interview, let alone multiple ones on the same day,
and although it was challenging, it was fairly enjoyable, and at the end of the day I felt I&rsquo;d done quite well.</p>

<p>My interviewers must have agreed, because a week later I received a phone call telling me I&rsquo;d gotten the job! Then began the surprisingly difficult process of trying
to find accommodation for ten weeks of summer in London. After a lot of looking and inquiries that went nowhere, I managed to find a student looking to transfer the
remainder of the contract for their accommodation due to them not planning to stay over the summer. I didn&rsquo;t visit the flat before moving down, but it worked out well
anyway, and it&rsquo;s small, it&rsquo;s centrally located in Southwark and is only three stops on the Jubilee line from Canary Wharf, where I could be commuting to each day.</p>

<p><img src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3928/19050613189_f58ac0f4df_c.jpg" alt="Roof View" title="My accommodation building has a roof terrace with pretty good views of the city, you can see the Houses of Parliment in the distance." /></p>

<p>Having not visited London very much in the past, my experience of living here for the past week has really exceeded expectations. There&rsquo;s history and museums all over
the city, tons of great pubs, caf√©s and restaurants, and events going on all the time. In the time I&rsquo;ve spent exploring the city, I&rsquo;ve been discovering more and more
things to do while I&rsquo;m here.</p>

<p><img src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3946/19240697701_ba5399d3c9_c.jpg" alt="Parade" title="Last weekend I was able to see the parade commemorating the 200th anniversity of the Battle of Waterloo." /></p>

<p>As can be expected at such a large organisation, my first week in work has consisted mostly of training and getting to know the people I&rsquo;ll be working with. Although I
haven&rsquo;t been able to get on with any proper work yet, there&rsquo;s been quite a few highlights. We had a one day crash course in investment banking, which was very informative
and really helped me understand how banks work. There was also a event with free food and drinks for us to get to know our managers, and on Friday I attended a few
talks from developers giving an overview on how Morgan Stanley processes FOREX orders, which is the area I&rsquo;ll be working in during my internship.</p>

<p>So, after a good first week, I&rsquo;m thoroughly looking forward to the next nine, and hopefully I&rsquo;ll have plenty more to write about by the end of it!</p>
