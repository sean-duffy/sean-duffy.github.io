  <h1>A summary of Summer</h1>
  <time datetime=2015-10-10T10:00:00Z class="post-date">Posted on October 10, 2015</time>
  <p>I&rsquo;ve had a very busy and fairly productive summer, so in this post I&rsquo;ll be summarising what I&rsquo;ve been up to! After finishing my university exams and coming back home for the summer, I was pleased to learn that I&rsquo;d scored 77% overall for my first year. My first year mark doesn&rsquo;t actually count towards my degree, but it&rsquo;s a good reassurance that yes, I indeed can do computer science!</p>

<p><a href="http://seanduffy.co.uk/blog/2013/8/ScraperWiki:-Part-I/">ScraperWiki</a> kindly invited me back to work for them this summer, so after a couple of weeks of rest I started work there. You can read all about that in my  Of course most of their software is open source, so you can see all the code I wrote! After settling in I was introduced to the first project I&rsquo;d be working on. I wrote about this in a separate post, which you can read <a href="http://seanduffy.co.uk/blog/2014/9/Project_-XLSX-Endpoint/">here</a>.</p>

<p>I also worked on some other projects, the main one being replacing the code being used to access the database in scrapers running on the ScraperWiki platform. This isn&rsquo;t yet deployed, but you can see the progress <a href="https://github.com/scraperwiki/scraperwiki-python">here</a>.</p>

<p>Overall I had a great time at ScraperWiki, it was good to be doing productive work and certainly nice to get so much experience with Go, a language I&rsquo;d heard about quite often previously and which I am now fairly enthusiastic about. I&rsquo;m currently working on an app to provide a better way to browse YouTube subscription feeds, solving one of my own problems, and I chose Go to write the majority of it. You can expect to hear more about that project soon, when I get it to a minimally working state.</p>

<p>This summer I also went on holidays to Portugal with my parents and Rome with my girlfriend Sophie, and had a fantastic time during both. I&rsquo;ll be heading back to university in a few weeks and there are some very interesting looking modules in second year, such as &lsquo;Vision and Graphics&rsquo; and &lsquo;Systems and Compilers&rsquo;. I&rsquo;ll also be learning C for my embedded systems project, which I&rsquo;m told will make me miss several things about Go, such as garbage collection. And so this concludes the end of my summer update, I&rsquo;ll be looking forward to getting back to university and will hopefully make some more blog posts then!</p>
